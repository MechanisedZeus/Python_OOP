various example python scripts using Object Oriented Programming that demonstrate various programming concepts


Included are various Object Oriented Proggraming scripts that demonstrate various prgraming concepts such as queues and stack.

These scripts are created as part of my A-level computer science lessons in which our teacher gives us various problems such as make a stack in python
and we must find a working solution.

The scrips should only be used as a guide for how real implementations of theses concepts should be made however all the code is built in a way where data strucres
can have a specified size.
